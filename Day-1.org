/Before moving for Networking History Let's start with the..../

* History of Communication

- In ancient times people used to draw cave paintings the oldest known cave painting is located within Chauvet Cave.
- Later the Petroglyphs became the medium of communication.
- In an around 9000 BCE the Pictograms were developed which is a symbol representing a concept, object, activity, place or event by illustration.
- After some time the Pictograms(Pictograph) evolved into ideograms, graphical symbols that represent an idea.
- Then evolve writing The oldest-known forms of writing were primarily logographic in nature, based on pictographic and ideographic elements. 
- Later the alphabet came into existence.
- Storytelling which is Verbal communication is one of the earliest forms of human communication.

/After exploring the History of Communication and Telecommunication, let's dive into the History and Introduction of Computer Networking./

* introduction

** What is Network ?
Dictionary defines the word Network i.e. "/a group or system of interconnected people or things./" Similarly, 
in Computer world the term /network/ means two or more connected computers that can share resources such as data, pictures, applications and etc

In the above picture we can say that the two computers/hosts connected to each other sharing files and computer 2 (host 2) is connected to the printer. These two computers/hosts "talk" to each other in binary language that comprises of 0s & 1s

* History of Networks

- 1958: The Bell 101 modem, the first commercial modem, allowed digital data transmission over telephone lines at 110 bit/s, crucial for the U.S. military‚Äôs SAGE radar system.
- 1959: Christopher Strachey and John McCarthy initiated early time-sharing concepts. McCarthy‚Äôs work led to the creation of the first time-sharing systems.
- 1959: Anatoly Kitov proposed a Soviet computing network for military and economic control, which was rejected.
- 1960: SABRE, the airline reservation system, went online with connected mainframes.
- 1963: J.C.R. Licklider proposed the "Intergalactic Computer Network" concept for general computer communications.
- 1965: Western Electric introduced the first computer-controlled telephone switch.
- 1960s: Paul Baran and Donald Davies independently developed the concept of packet switching, foundational for data communication networks.
- 1969:  The first four nodes of ARPANET were connected, marking the start of what would become the internet.
- 1973: The French CYCLADES network and Peter Kirstein‚Äôs work at UCL were key milestones in developing internetworking concepts.
- 1974: Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn published a seminal paper on internetworking, introducing TCP/IP, and coining the term "Internet."
- 1976-77: Ethernet was developed and became an open standard, significantly impacting local computer networks.
- 1980-1998: Ethernet speeds increased from 10 Mbit/s to 1 Gbit/s, contributing to its widespread adoption and scalability.

This summary captures the evolution of key technologies and concepts that laid the foundation for modern computer networks and the internet.
