** Network Connectivity Devices

* Switches

[[Netwokingimages/mobile_switches.png]]

- Switches connect multiple segments of a network together much like hubs.
- Switches are also known as 'Smarter Hubs'
- It is responsible for filtering and forwarding the packets between LAN segments based on MAC address. 
- A switch recognizes frames and pays attention to the source and destination MAC address of the incoming frame as well as the port on which it was received.
- A switch makes each of its ports a unique, singular collision domain.
- As switches use MAC addresses to make forwarding decisions, they are considered Layer 2 devices. 


/*Note:  Switches are Layer 2 devices, which means they segment the network with MAC addresses. If you see the term Layer 3 switch , that means you are
talking about a router, not a Layer 2 switch. The terms router and Layer 3 switch are interchangeable.*/

**How switches Works ?

1. When the source wants to send the data packet to the destination:
   - The packet first enters the switch.
   - The switch reads the packet's header.
   - The switch finds the MAC address of the destination to identify the device.
   - The switch sends the packet out through the appropriate ports that lead to the destination device.

2. The switch establishes a temporary connection between the source and destination for communication.

3. The switch terminates the connection once the conversation is done.

4. The switch offers full bandwidth to network traffic going to and from a device simultaneously to reduce collision.

Advantages and Disadvantage of Switches

- Advantages:
   - Prevents traffic overloading in a network by segmenting the network into smaller subnets.
   - Increases the bandwidth of the network.
   - Less frame collision as the switch creates the collision domain for each connection.

- Disadvantages:
   - It can not stop traffic destined for a different LAN segment from traveling to all other LAN segments.
   - Switches are more expensive.

** Network switch vs Hub

| Network Switch                                             | Hub                                           |
|------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Network Switch is a device of layer 2 of the OSI Model.    | Hub is a physical device of Layer 1 of the OSI Model. |
| Network Switch is a little more complex than a Hub.        | Hub is a simple device as compared to Network Switch. |
| Network Switch easily manages data in and out, hence less communication collision. | Communication Collisions usually happen in a Hub. |
| Network Switches transfer data together by connecting devices. | The main task of Hub is to connect all nodes of the network. |
| Switches prevent collision with the help of Ethernet frames. | Hubs cannot help in preventing collisions.    |
