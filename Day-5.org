** Network Connectivity Devices

* Bridges

- Connects two similar network together.
- We also say that it uses to connect multiple LANs togther with a larger Local Area Network (LAN).
- Its primary function is to keep traffic separated on either side of the bridge, breaking up collision domains.
- The main reasons you would place a bridge in your network would be to connect two segments together or to divide a busy network into two segments. 
- It uses MAC addresses to make forwarding decisions.
- It is a Data-Link (Layer 2) layer device.

** How bridges 
- Get data packets from both sides network segments.
- Creats the table of MAC address for incoming networks.
- If the data packets are meant to sent on the segment A then it does not forwarding it to another segment.
- If the data packets are meant to sent to segment B from segment A then it will reach to the segment B.


** Functions of Bridges in the Network 
- The bridge is used to divide LANs into multiple segments.
- To control the traffic in the network.
- It can interconnect two LANs with a similar protocols. 
- It can filter the data based on destination/MAC address. 

** Advantages
- Bridges can be used as a network extension like they can connect two network topologies together. 
- It has a separate collision domain, which results in increased bandwidth. 
- It can create a buffer when different MAC protocols are there for different segments. 
- Highly reliable and maintainable. The network can be divided into multiple LAN segments. 
- Simple installation, no requirement of any extra hardware or software except the bridge itself. 
- Protocol transparency is higher as compared to other protocols. 

Disadvantages
- Expensive as compared to hubs and repeaters.
- Slow in speed. 
- Poor performance as additional processing is required to view the MAC address of the device on the network. 
- As the traffic received is in bulk or is broadcasted traffic, individual filtering of data is not possible. 
- During the broadcasting of data, the network has high broadcast traffic and broadcast storms can be formed.
