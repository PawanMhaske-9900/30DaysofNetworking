* Introduction to Networking:

Computer network is a group of computer connected with each other through rules, optical fibers or optical links so that various devices can interact with each other through network.


* Components of Networking :

1. ** Clients :  Devices that users access the network with e.g. workstation, laptops, tablets, & smartphones.

2. ** Servers:   Provide resources to the network eg. email servers, file servers, web servers and many others. 
                 These servers can exist on hardware devices or they can rely on specialized software that allows
                 a device to act as a server for other clients on a network.

3. ** Hubs : Older network device that connect other devices like clients and servers over a Local Area Network.
             It is a Layer 1 device

4. ** Switches : Switches connect multiple segments of a network together much like hubs do, but with
                 three significant differences—a switch recognizes frames and pays attention to the source
                 and destination MAC address of the incoming frame as well as the port on which it was received.

                 A switch makes each of its ports a unique, singular collision domain. Hubs don’t do those things.

                 Switches are Layer 2 devices, which means they segment the network with MAC addresses.

                 A switch connects devices within LAN (Local Area Network).
