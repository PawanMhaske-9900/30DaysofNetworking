* Introduction to Networking:

  Computer networks are groups of computers connected with each other through cables, optical fibers, or wireless links so that various devices can interact with each other through the network.

* Components of Networking:

1. **Clients**: Devices that users access the network with, e.g., workstations, laptops, tablets, and smartphones.

2. **Servers**: Provide resources to the network, e.g., email servers, file servers, web servers, and many others. These servers can exist on hardware devices or rely on specialized software that allows a device to act as a server for other clients on a network.

3. **Hubs**: Older network devices that connect other devices like clients and servers over a Local Area Network. Hubs operate at Layer 1 of the OSI model.

4. **Switches**: Switches connect multiple segments of a network together, much like hubs do, but with three significant differences:
   - A switch recognizes frames and pays attention to the source and destination MAC addresses of the incoming frame, as well as the port on which it was received.
   - A switch makes each of its ports a unique, singular collision domain, whereas hubs do not.
   - Switches are Layer 2 devices, meaning they segment the network with MAC addresses.

   A switch connects devices within a LAN (Local Area Network).
