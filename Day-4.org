** Network Connectivity Devices

* Hubs

[[Netwokingimages/cap1-6_html_26b15f7d.jpg]]

- A Hub is a hardware device which is used to connect multiple devices in network.
- It is a Layer 1 (Physical Layer) device.
- It is widely connect the LANs.
- Hub have 4/12 ports.	
- A hub cannot filter data like Switches.
- Also cannot identify the destination packets.
- so it simply sends the messege to other port/node. so that Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) on the transmitter can monitor for collisions. 
- Each device in the network connects directly to the hub through a single cable and is used to connect multiple devices without segmenting a network.
- A typical hub as you might fi nd it employed within a small network.

- In the above diagram we can see that the both the users can send the messeges to each other over the LAN using HUB.
- Hubs can't identify specific packets, so messages sent by one user are broadcasted to all users. This lack of security and efficiency makes hubs unsuitable for modern corporate networks.


/Note: In the hub, data is sent to all ports but each port accepts only that data whose destination address matches their MAC address. /

** Features of Hub
- It supports half-duplex transmission
- It works with shared bandwidth and broadcasting.
- The hub can provide a high data transmission rate to different devices. 
- It can detect collisions in the network and send the jamming signal to each port. 
- Hub does not support Virtual LAN(VLAN) and spanning tree protocol.
- It is unable to filter the data and hence transmit or broadcast it to each port. 
- It cannot find the best route/ shortest path to send any data, which makes it an inefficient device. 


** Advantages and Disadvantages of hubs
Advantages:
- It is less expensive.
- It does not impact network performance. 
- Hub support different network media.

Disadvantages:
- It cannot find the best/ shortest path of the network. 
- No mechanism for traffic detection. 
- No mechanism for data filtration. 
- Not capable of connecting to different network topologies like token ring, ethernet, etc.
