- NIC stands for (Network Interface Card) is additionally called Ethernet or physical or Network card.
- It provides the physical, electrical, and electronic connections to the network media.
- The NIC is both a physical layer and data link layer device, as it provides physical access to a networking medium 
- And for IEEE 802 (Wi-fi) and similar networks, provides a low-level addressing system through the use of MAC addresses that are uniquely assigned to network interfaces.
- The NIC is Layer 2 device because the information it uses for communication, the MAC address, resides on the Data Link layer.
- NIC is important for us to establish a wired and wireless connection over network.
- Usually indicates the speed of the connection: 10, 100, or 1000Mbps.
- A NIC either is an expansion card or is built right into the computer’s motherboard. but in today's period the NIC is usually in-built into Computer's Motherboard.
- NIC adapters can be connected to the USB port or through a PC card slot.

/Note : NICs today usually have one, two, or more LEDs; one, usually green, is called a link light, indicating that an Ethernet connection has been established with the device on the
       other end of the cable, and it flickers when traffic is being passed back or forth./

** Types of Network Interface Cards

- Wired NICs ( Ethernet NIC ) :
   - Created by Robert MetCalfe in 1980s.
   - This types of NICs uses cables to connect to the networks.
   - It is more secure than wireless NIC.
   - It is used in LAN, MAN, WAN and Gaming environment.

- Wireless NICs :
   - Uses radio signals to connect to the network.
   - Commonly use for Wi-fi connections.
   - Portable and built it into devices like laptops & Phones.

** Advantages and Disadvantages of NIC
Advantages:
- The communication speed utilizing the Web is high ordinarily in Gigabytes.
- Highly dependable connection.
- Many peripheral gadgets can be associated with utilizing numerous ports of NIC cards.
- Bulk information can be shared among numerous clients.

Disadvantages:
- Badly arranged in case of wired cable NIC, because it isn’t versatile like a remote router
- The arrangement ought to be appropriate for superior communication.
- Data is unsecured.
